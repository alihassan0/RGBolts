	you already have a tutorial

	okay :D 
	let's make it more interesting
	INTRODUCING the "remover " block .
	
	to understand it first you need to understand 
	the sequence . for simplicity we will call it seq
	
	seq is a queue of (one or more)bolts that move
	in order in a certain direction. 

	the removeFirst block devides the seq into two seqs
	
	the first one: containts the first bolt only .which 
	moves in the direction of the black arrow .

	the second one: containts the rest of the bolts
 	.which moves in the direction of the grey arrow .
</level>	

<level>
	nice .. 
	now let's make sure you understand those 
	two previous blocks good enough .. and why nots 
	introduce a new block as well . 

	but first you must understand the "iterator"
	iterator is just a directional block and remover
	block facing each other(with the remover gray block
	directed towards the directional block) . which allow 
	you to get all bolts of a seq one at a time .

	and for the new block is the red-filter block .. it will look on the first
	color of the block and will leave it if it's not 
	rid .. and will redirect it if it was red ... 
	can you solve it in three blocks only ?
</level>

<level>
	okay one last check .. can you filter the blue color
	you can use the new block green-filter block now .. 
</level>

<level>
	i will intoduce you now to a very interesting block 
	the signal block .. it basicly transforms the block it
	touches to a signal independent of what it's content is
	. the signal can be used to toggle blocks on and off
	. a disabled block will not affect a seq untill
	it's enabled again
