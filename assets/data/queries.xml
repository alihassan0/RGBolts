	hello and welcomr to nawwar's Color Box 
	let's get you started with the basics 
	in this level you have to direct the 
	input seq(Sequence) from the input block
	to the output block using the directionl block
	only the directional block doesn't affect the seq
	internally .. it changes it's direction only .
</level>	
<level>
	good job  now le'ts add another useful block
	the removefirst block .. to understand it first 
	you understand what seq is . seq is a container
	that list of one or more colors .. you can preview
	any seq by hovering on it .. .. the removeFirst block 
	devids the currunt seq into two seq .. one containing
	the first color only .. and the second contains
	the rest of the colors
</level>	

<level>
	nice .. now let's make sure you understand those 
	two previous blocks good enough .. as well as 
	introduce a new more block .. this new block is 
	the red-filter block .. it will look on the first
	color of the block and will leave it if it's not 
	rid .. and will redirect it if it was red ... 
	can you solve it in three blocks only ?
</level>

<level>
	okay one last check .. can you filter the blue color
	you can use the new block green-filter block now .. 
</level>

<level>
	i will intoduce you now to a very interesting block 
	the signal block .. it basicly transforms the block it
	touches to a signal independent of what it's content is
	. the signal can be used to toggle blocks on and off
	. a disabled block will not affect a seq untill
	it's enabled again
